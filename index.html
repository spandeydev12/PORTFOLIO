        <h2>About Me
             </h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Sampurnanand Pandey, a passionate and driven Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) graduate with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from AKTU.
        <br>
        I’m deeply interested in building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems using data-driven approaches. With a solid foundation in programming, machine learning algorithms, and data analysis, I enjoy working on innovative projects that merge technology with creativity. Whether it's developing AI models, exploring new tools, or optimizing code, I'm always eager to learn and improve.
            <br>
        I’m currently looking for opportunities where I can contribute to impactful AI/ML projects while continuing to grow as a developer and problem-solve</p>
